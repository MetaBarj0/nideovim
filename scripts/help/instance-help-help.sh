The \`make instance-help\` command displays help for a chosen \`instance\`.

The process is fully interactive and divided in 2 steps:

1. You are told to choose one \`instance\` among all existing ones. Note that
   the default \`instance\` is proposed first thus, if this is the default
   \`instance\` you want to get the help from, just hit <enter>.
2. Read the friendly manual of the chosen \`instance\`.
