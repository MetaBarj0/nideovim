cat <<EOF
The \`make list\` command prints a list of created \`instances\`.

It's a simple command letting you know what are the \`instances\` that exist on
the system.

Note that a created \`instance\` must be built before you can use it.
If the \`type\` of the \`instance\` derives from \`base\`, \`make build\`
should do the job.
