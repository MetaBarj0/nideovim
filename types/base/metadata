This is the \`base\` type, ancestor of all \`types\`.

Despite its name, this \`type\` is perfectly capable to handle quite a lot of
project types.
For example, \`nideovim\` itself has been built and tested using the \`base\`
type.

More specifically, this \`type\` can support C/C++ (llvm), Node.js and bash
projects.

You should use the \`base type\` as \`type\` ancestor, should you plan to
create your own \`type\`.
Of course, you can also rely on a \`type\` that has the \`base type\` as
ancestor.
