# nideovim

A development environment fabricator.
Built around docker , debian , neovim  and LazyVim 💤 with awesome community
plugins.

It can create, manage and get you right into a fully integrated development
environment with minimum hassle💢 for maximum productivity📈.

## prerequisites

### usage

- terminal based
- no graphical user interface (no need of that)

### tooling

- POSIX compliant shell 󱆃
- rev 
- cut 
- docker  (either native or Docker Desktop or Orbstack)
  - buildx plugin
  - compose plugin
- make 
- command 
- GNU sed 
- (optional) less 

Generally speaking, a recent linux distribution or MacOS should do the job.
For MacOS, ensure to install `gsed` using Homebrew for instance.

### hardware

- some giga-bytes of free storage 󰋊 to build and use the stuff
- ideally, a good rig with some processing  power and RAM  (accelerate
  builds)

## how to use?

- a good start is to type `make help` 󰋖
- the next step is to type `make help-help` (for the boldest of you).
- to get even more help, type `make help-help-help-help-help-help-help`
  - Nah just kidding, `help-help` is the maximum level.
- More seriously, create an `instance` and try the thing to get an opinion.
